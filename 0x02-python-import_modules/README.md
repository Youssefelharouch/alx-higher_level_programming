# Project Title: 0x02-python-import_modules

## Project Description:
This project primarily centers around the exploration of importing modules in Python. It offers a range of exercises and illustrative examples to facilitate users' comprehension of module importation, utilization of module functions, and interaction with namespaces.

## Project Structure:
The project consists of several files and directories:

- **README.md**  This file serves as a project overview.
- **0-add.py**:  It's a Python script that demonstrates the importation of a function from the "add_0" module and showcases how to use it.
- **1-calculation.py**: This Python script showcases the importation of functions from the "calculator_1" module and illustrates their usage.
- **2-args.py**: A Python script that imports a function from the "sys" module and demonstrates command-line argument handling.
- **3-infinite_add.py**: A Python script that imports a function from the "sys" module and demonstrates adding numbers from the command line.
- **4-hidden_discovery.py**: A Python script that imports names from a module and lists all names defined by the module, including those that are hidden.
- **5-variable_load.py**: A Python script that imports a variable from a module and prints its value.
- **100-my_calculator.py**: A Python script that imports functions from a calculator module and performs mathematical calculations based on user input.
- **101-easy_print.py**: A Python script that imports a hidden function from a module and prints a predefined string.
- **102-magic_calculation.py**: A Python function that replicates the functionality of a given bytecode using disassembled Python code.

## Usage:
You can independently run each Python script in the project to showcase the utilization of module imports and associated concepts. Execute a script with the Python interpreter, as shown in this example: python3 0-add.py.
