# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

## Description
This project involves linking the worlds of databases and Python using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). It includes using the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and executing SQL queries. In the second part, it involves using the SQLAlchemy module, an ORM, to abstract the storage to the usage, allowing Python code to be used without writing SQL queries. The project aims to make the code "storage type" independent and easily changeable without rewriting the entire project.

## Before you start
Before starting the project, it is important to ensure that the MySQL server is in 8.0. 

## Background Context
The project involves using MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries. It also uses SQLAlchemy, an ORM, to abstract the storage to the usage.

## Resources
The project provides resources for further reading and watching on the topics related to ORM, MySQLdb, and SQLAlchemy. It also includes tutorials and guides for learning the required concepts and tools.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, the learner is expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google, the general concepts and techniques related to Python programming, connecting to a MySQL database from a Python script, using ORM, and creating a Python Virtual Environment.

## Copyright - Plagiarism
The project emphasizes the originality of the solutions and strictly prohibits any form of plagiarism. 

## Requirements
The project outlines the general requirements such as allowed editors, interpreter version, mandatory files, code style, documentation, and dependencies.

## More Info
The "More Info" section provides instructions for installing and activating venv, installing MySQLdb module, and installing SQLAlchemy module.
